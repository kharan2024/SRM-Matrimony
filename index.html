                <p class="card-text">Darshan is the kind of guy who loses a ₹10k watch and shrugs it off like it’s pocket change.

But despite his carefree nature, he’s the first to show up when called and never hesitates to send money when needed. His carelessness is balanced by his big heart, making him the friend you can always count on, even if he forgets his own wallet!</p>

However, his journey to getting a license was more of a marathon than a sprint—it took him a whole year! Despite his polished demeanor, he has a slight knack for being a bummer at times, and when it comes to jokes, let’s just say his humor needs some fine-tuning. Yet, his sincerity and grounded nature make him someone you can always rely on, even if he’s not the life of the party!</p>
